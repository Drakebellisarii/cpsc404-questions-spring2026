## Question

HYBHY Chapter 4 emphasizes that part of "I got this" is letting your boss know when you need help. ProducingOSS Chapter 8 offers detailed advice on giving praise and criticism, noting that "an important feature of technical culture is that detailed, dispassionate criticism is often taken as a kind of praise." How can a manager frame their help or criticism in a way that reinforces the employee's sense of responsibility ("I got this") rather than undermining it? How does the culture of peer review in open source relate to the manager-employee feedback dynamic in a traditional workplace?
