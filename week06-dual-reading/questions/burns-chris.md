# Week 2 Question - HYBHY CH4 + ProducingOSS CH8

## Question

In “I Got This: Taking Responsibility”, it says “how much of your inner turmoil do you show to your boss?” And answers this question with “That depends on the relationship and the individuals involved, but the key is that you want your boss to know that whatever happens, you’ll figure it out.” This is in response to the topic of how you handle uncertainty and what kinds of tasks you want to do. It discusses sticking to tasks you do know how to do, or getting tired of those, and trying to solve problems you don’t know the answer to. In ProducingOSS, the “Transitions” section explains the situation in which you have to move to someone else for a project or task since there are many problems with it. If choosing to handle a task you don’t know how to do can get you in this position where managers may have to pick someone else to do it after many attempts by you, when is it appropriate to take on these challenging tasks? Could failure to complete a task in this case affect the trust that a manager has that “you got this”?

## Context (optional)

It is often difficult to do things you don’t know how to do, and it can take quite some time to figure them out. In the business world, this may be an issue when it comes to deadlines, and it’s not always certain that you will be able to figure out. This can cause worry and stress amongst the person, and even if you do get the job done, perhaps your manager might rethink some of the trust they put in you due to turmoils you made evident.
