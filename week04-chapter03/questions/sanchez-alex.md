CH3: Creating Constructive Loyalty
**Student:** Alex Sanchez
**Date:** February 12, 2026

## Question
Managers value loyalty because their success is difficult to measure and depends heavily on others, while employees need to trust their managers to get them the resources they need to do their jobs well. Who has more responsibility for maintaining trust and constructive loyalty when a manager makes decisions that do not align or favor the employee?

## Context 
The chapter explains the relationship between trust and loyalty and it's importance for the relationship between both managers and employees, who do not share the same responsibilities. Employees rely on managers for support and to acquire resources, while managers rely on employee loyalty because their success is more challenging to measure.  

Constructive loyalty is defined as being able to push back when a manager makes a decision that is not in your best interest but in a way that does not threaten the loyalty relationship.
